# Open Dojo

Is always welcome to new apprentices. Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose and always pass on what you have learned.

The goal of this task is to check your ability to test, refactor and implement new functionality on a given system.

## Tasks

1. Make sure test suite runs through all of the tests successfully. Hint: it won't at first.
2. Refactor implementation code and tests where you see fit. You have as much freedom here as you wish.
3. Implement new functionality. More details below.

## New Functionality

Master gives lessons to his apprentices. The lessons could be theoretical or practical, have period (time interval) and state of acomplishment for every apprentice. As soon as apprentice completes lesson he achieves next rank. Also it's very useful for master to get all uncompleted theoretical lessons and group them by assigned apprentices.

## Notes & Requirements

* Try not to spend more than 4 hours on this task. This will constrain you not to spend too much time on trivial details (sometimes you have to make compromises in order to deliver fast).
* You may refactor not only the code in the models, but in tests too. Keep in mind that test code is still code needs to be maintained.
* Use git to track your changes.
* When finished, simply zip the project and send it via e-mail.

Good luck!
